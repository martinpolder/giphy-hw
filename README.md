# giphy-hw

This project uses AJAX queries to call to the GIPHY API and use Jquery javascript to dynamically incorporate them into the webpage.
The GIFs are loaded in a pause state by my default setting and can be played upon click.
Styled with CSS, I chose a campy digital theme with wireframe buttons. Not pleasing to current tastes, but heavy on a silly 90s style.

Have fun playing around with it!
